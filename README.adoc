= Asciidoctor.js integration with Webpack

== Usage

Install the dependencies:

 $ npm install

Build the project:

 $ npm run build

Open the `index.html` page in your browser.
You should see the following sentence: "Asciidoctor running on Opal brings AsciiDoc to the browser!".

== Integration

Asciidoctor.js is imported in the file `src/index.js`:

```js
import Asciidoctor from 'asciidoctor.js';
```

The `webpack` command will resolve the `import` and generate a bundle in the [.path]_dist_ directory: `dist/bundle.js`.
